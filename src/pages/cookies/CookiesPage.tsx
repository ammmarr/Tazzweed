            This is applicable if you are using our services; subscribing to
            Jirlie, using any of our trial versions, requesting for a demo or
            contacting us for enquiry via e-mail. We use cookies within our
            online services (such as websites, browser-based applications, or
            apps) as well as other technologies that gather information that
            helps us improve these services and your online experience. Some of
            the cookies or other technologies used require your explicit
            consent. We ask that you consent to the use of cookies so that you
            can fully enjoy all the features provided by our online services. We
            provide this notice to you to comply with our legal obligation to
            let you know what cookies we use when you use our online services
            and how we protect your privacy. We refer to “cookies” for all
            technologies, including text file-based (“classical”) cookies, web
            beacons, pixels, as well as script trackers and other programmatic
            client-side technologies that can capture user information, explain
            its purpose, extent of use, and opportunities to manage and control
            the behaviour of these technologies. For the sake of consistency,
            all of these methods will collectively be referred to as "cookies"
            unless explicitly differentiated between individual methods. The
            Cookie Policy applies to our online services under the domains owned
            by Neu Ocean; including but not limited to neuocean.com and
            jirlie.com. The Cookie Policy can be accessed, saved and printed on
            our website at any time. By using our online services, you agree
            that we may use cookies in accordance with this Policy. For more
            information about our use of your information, see our Privacy
            Policy. Cookies and other technologies are used to enable certain
            features within online services, such as the recognition of a user,
            to save preferences of a user, user-unique transactions or
            transaction-related data, and for additional security when a user
            logs in to his user account. Furthermore, cookies are used to
            collect information about the use of an online service and improve
            its use and make it more efficient. These technologies are also used
            by almost all online services – which may also be offered by third
            parties – to detect whether the online service has already been
            called up with the same device and browser in order to adapt and, in
            some cases, vary the content displayed. Cookies and other
            technologies can be set and used by Neu Ocean, but also by third
            parties who are not part of Neu Ocean, but whose content is
            integrated within our online service. This includes content such as
            videos, online-based applications, or analytical tools that help us
            to improve this online service, as well as content that is
            user-enabled, such as clicks on "share" buttons with content from
            social media such as Facebook, LinkedIn or Twitter. For third-party
            cookies, this Policy applies equally. Whether a cookie comes from a
            first-party vendor or a third-party vendor depends on the domain
            that places the cookie. First-party cookies are cookies placed by
            the online service that the user visits. Third-party cookies are
            cookies placed by a domain other than the domain of the online
            service that the user visits. Third-party providers place their
            cookies in the online service of the first-party provider, as long
            as they provide technologies that the first-party provider uses or
            provides to its users within its online service. Neu Ocean has
            agreed on Commissioned Data Processing Agreements or comparable
            agreements according to Art. 28 (3) GDPR with these third-party
            providers. Cookies can only be read from the online service from
            which the cookie originated. Cookies do not collect personal
            information stored on your device. Cookies are just the key to
            connecting to personal information, if it has been collected at all.
